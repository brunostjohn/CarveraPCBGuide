# How to make PCBs at home with a Carvera Air

This is a super in-progress guide for doing this. There's probably many better ways to do this, this is just what's worked for me.

## Materials & Tools

### Materials

- Copper clad FR4, duh.
- UV-curable solder mask (both in target solder mask colour and white, you'll see why).
- Some random ass wood. (should fit on the Carvera bed)
- Double sided tape
